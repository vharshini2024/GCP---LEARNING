# VPC- VIRTUAL PRIVATE CLOUD

VPC is a virtualized network environment within GCP that allows you to define and control network resources such as IP addresses, subnets, firewalls, and routes. It provides a private network for your GCP resources, similar to an on-premises network.

## Subnets 
Segments of the VPC network. They are regional resources and can span multiple zones within a region.
